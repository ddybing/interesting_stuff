* Injecting an answer file
  The answer file (unattend.xml) is located at %systemdrive%\Windows\Panther\unattend.xml

** Injecting an answer file into a sysprepped image
   It is possible to inject an answer file into a sysprepped image, in order to customise 
   the Windows Out of the Box Experience (OOBE) segment, which is the last step in a Windows installation before
   the user is taken to the Windows desktop.


** Injecting an answer file into a sysprepped image that has reached OOBE. 
   The answer file must be injected before the image is booted and the OOBE screen is reached. Otherwise, a sort
   of counter will be "tripped", that causes Windows to ignore the answer file on the next reboot. It may be possible
   to get Windows to detect the answer file without having to sysprep the image all over again - I am currently
   researching this!
